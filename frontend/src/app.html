			<h2>JavaScript seems to be disabled</h2>
			<p>
				The Project-W frontend is a SPA and as such requires JavaScript to
				function. Your browser doesn't seem to support JavaScript. Try enabling
				it in your browser settings or try again with a different browser.
			</p>
			<p>
				Alternatively you can also check out
				<a

					>the API docs</a
				>if you want to use Project-W without the official frontend (there are
				also nicer Swagger and ReDoc docs available but accessing them requires
				JavaScript too).
